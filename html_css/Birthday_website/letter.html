            <p>Happiest Birthday to my saviour . You‚Äôre the only person in my life whom I‚Äôll always keep first, no
                matter what the situation is. You‚Äôre not just my sister but my whole family. We may not be that kind of
                sisters who say ‚ÄúI Love You‚Äù in every sentence and we may fight a lot but I always know the love and
                care you carry in your heart for me provides the safest place for me to escape to.
                You‚Äôre my role model since forever. I wish I can become a person like you in every aspect of life. I
                wish I can be as strong as you are, I know about all the things you‚Äôve faced but you never stop. You
                put
                the most beautiful smile on your face and continue with the same energy. You‚Äôre the best person one can
                have to look up to in every situation. You‚Äôre literally perfect in everything (even in scolding tooüò¢).
                This is my biggest flex in life that I have a sister like you who is always filled with love. I can
                never repay the amount of love, care and comfort you‚Äôve showered on me. You‚Äôve done so much for me that
                I can never thank you enough for that. I know I‚Äôve always got you by my side. And if I can ever make you
                feel good, even if just 1% then I think I‚Äôll be relieved. I don‚Äôt lie when I say that my life goal is to
                be
                a person
                like you.
                Even the thought of missing you brings tears in my eyes. When you used to cook special food items, those
                failed cake baking attempts, when you used to get irritated by me but still taught me the same thing
                again
                and again, those scooty rides, sharing everything about my day with you, laughing with you, telling my
                mistakes to you even though I knew I would get scolded, eating with you, sleeping beside you, having
                coffee
                together, you waking me up and making lunch for me whenever mummy wasn‚Äôt home, celebrating birthdays
                together. And there are many more memories which hit my heart very bad because those times were the best
                and I wish I can live those moments daily. The time we get to spend together can never fill that void
                that my heart feels being away from you. I lovee youuu the most and no one can ever replace you!
